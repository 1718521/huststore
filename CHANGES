    This is the first stable release, with important bug fixes and a few new features:
    *) Refactor the architect of HustDB HA, which is important for the availability of HA.
        *) libsync is extracted as a standlone sync server from master process of HA.

    *) Fix bug on HustMQ HA & HustDB HA & sync server
